Every now and then one film comes along that changes the path of the film indusry and sets a new standard for other to follow.
I just love **bold text**.
### Lucifer is not that.

![Lucifer]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lucifer.jpg)

Prithviraj is a big fan of MohanLal and decides to make a film on him and evryone else must watch and praise it. That is the logic of what has been shown on screen.

My 4 word review is<span class="spoiler">it's a telugu film.</span>

#### Why anyone would watch?
Because they have brains filled with cowdung.
